# boilerplate
My own Webpack + React + TypeScript boilerplate for personal projects.

Start the development server with hot reloading enabled:
```
yarn start
```

Start the development server running a production build without hot reloading:
```
yarn prod
```

Build a production bundle:
```
yarn build
```

Run unit tests and generate coverage:
```
yarn test
```
