# boilerplate
My own Webpack + React + TypeScript boilerplate for personal projects.

Start the development server with hot reloading enabled:
```

```

Start the development server running a production build without hot reloading:
```
npm run prod
```

Build a production bundle:
```
npm run build
```

Run unit tests:
```
npm test
```
